I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) working at the Dynamic Systems Lab supervised by [Prof. Angela Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/). I am interested in combining model predictive control with machine learning methods for safe and high performance robotic applications in uncertain and dynamic environments. 

Before joining UTIAS I spent time at [Prof. Francesco Borrelli's](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/francesco-borrelli/) MPC Lab at UC Berkeley, and [Prof. Ludovic Righetti's](https://www.is.mpg.de/~lrighetti) Movement Generation and Control Group at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in TÃ¼bingen. Previously I also worked at the Volkswagen Group Research Department in Wolfsburg and Silicon Valley. I received my Master's degree from Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) in Mechatronics.
