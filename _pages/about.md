I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto and the Technical University of Munich working at the Learning Systems and Robotics Lab supervised by [Prof. Angela Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/). I am interested in combining model-based control algorithms with machine learning methods for safe and high-performance robotic applications in uncertain and dynamic environments. Recently I worked on vehicle dynamics and vehicle control at [Prof. Raquel Urtasun's](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/) autonomous driving startup Waabi. 

Before joining the Learning Systems and Robotics Lab I spent time at [Prof. Francesco Borrelli's](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/francesco-borrelli/) MPC Lab at UC Berkeley, and [Prof. Ludovic Righetti's](https://www.is.mpg.de/~lrighetti) Movement Generation and Control Group at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in TÃ¼bingen. Previously I also worked at the Volkswagen Group Research Department in Wolfsburg and Silicon Valley. I received my master's degree from Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) in Mechatronics. 

**Student Theses**
I am open to supervising ambitious and talented master's and bachelor's students for their thesis. If you want to work with me, please send me an email describing your area of interest. Please also attach your CV and up-to-date transcripts.
